# Detecting Unusable Network Using Machine Learning

The project contains 2 tasks:
* predicting the bit rate using three or more appropriate machine learning models and then select the appropriate machine learning amongst them.
* detecting stream quality and test the effect of removing outliers and balancing the data on the result.

The first task is a regression task and the solution can be found in the file: **Regression.ipnyb** and the solution to the second in the file **Classification.ipnyb**. Both files are to be run from top to down.

The necessary packages that were used in the Regression.ipnyb include:
* python (>= 3.5)
* pandas (tested only with v1.4.2)
* matplotlib (tested only with v3.5.1)
* pandas_profiling (tested only with v3.2.0)
* scikit-learn (tested only with v1.0.2)
* seaborn (tested only with v0.11.2)

The packages that were used in the Classification.ipnyb include:
* python (>= 3.5)
* pandas (tested only with v1.4.2)
* matplotlib (tested only with v3.5.1)
* pandas_profiling (tested only with v3.2.0)
* scikit-learn (tested only with v1.0.2)
* seaborn (tested only with v0.11.2)
* classification-ipnyb (tested only with v2.5.0)
* numpy (tested only with v1.21.5)
* imblearn (tested only with 0.8.1)

Analysis of the solution can be found in report.pdf
